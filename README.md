## The Code
### The Structure
- The file [notes.tex](notes.tex) contains the general structure and order of the files. Building this file should build all the other `.tex` files, and include them in one `.pdf` called `notes.pdf`
- Each unit has a separate `tex` file where the notes are written.
- The styles, commands and packages used are in the package file [notestyles.sty](notestyles.sty)

### Packages Used
TeX packages that have been used are:
- [amsmath, amssymb](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath): Used for mathematical symbols and environments
- [babel](https://ctan.org/pkg/babel): Use description environment, and chapter renaming
- [changepage](https://ctan.org/pkg/changepage): Allow paragraphs to be indented
- [enumitem](https://ctan.org/pkg/enumitem): Used to improve the way lists are displayed
- [etoolbox](https://ctan.org/pkg/etoolbox): Allow commands to be patched
- [fancyhdr](https://ctan.org/pkg/fancyhdr): Improve header and footer display

- [geometry](https://ctan.org/pkg/geometry): Used for document margins
- [hyperref](https://ctan.org/pkg/hyperref): Add PDF bookmarks
- [parskip](https://ctan.org/pkg/parskip): Set proper default values for paragraph separation

  * Also uses libraries to simulate [booktabs](https://ctan.org/pkg/booktabs) and [varwidth](https://ctan.org/pkg/varwidth)
- [tcolorbox](https://ctan.org/pkg/tcolorbox), [adjustbox](https://ctan.org/pkg/adjustbox): Create colored boxes for different environments
- [tikz](https://ctan.org/pkg/tikz): Used for images
- [venndiagram](https://ctan.org/pkg/venndiagram): Easier support for Venn Diagram display than using pure tikz
- [xargs](https://ctan.org/pkg/xargs): Allow commands and environments to have more than one optional argument
- [xcolor](https://ctan.org/pkg/xcolor): Used to get more colors
- [xstring](https://ctan.org/pkg/xstring): Analyze strings given as arguments to an environment


### Commands Added
For intellisense, a list of the commands is added in the [package_intellisense](./package_intellisense/) folder. These have been written in formats that can be understood by different LaTeX tools.

#### Commands
- `addfile [input] {<filename>}`: Include or input the file into the document. By default, it includes the file, the option `input` can be given to input it instead.

- `rulebookend`: Insert a decorative horizontal line at the end of the text.
- `rulechapterend`: Insert a decorative horizontal line at the end of each unit.

#### Environments
- `answer`: Used to indicate an answer to a question in an exercise. Unbolds the text.
- `definition {title}`: Coloured box used for highlighting important concepts.
- `descriptenum`: Description environment, but enumerated.
- `descriptimize`: Description environment, but like the itemize environment, with bullets.
- `example`: Coloured box used to highlight examples.
- `exercise {title}`: Coloured box used to highlight exercises.
